# Password Generator

## Overview

The Password Generator is a simple application built using Python's Tkinter library. It generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length and strength.

## Features

- **Password Strength**: Users can choose the strength of the generated password from three options: Weak, Medium, and Strong.
- **Password Length**: Users can specify the length of the password using a spinbox.
- **Generate Password**: Clicking the "Generate" button creates a random password based on the selected strength and length.
- **Copy Password**: Users can copy the generated password to the clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button.

## Usage

2. Choose the desired strength and length for the password.
3. Click the "Generate" button to generate a password.
4. Click the "Copy" button to copy the generated password to the clipboard.
